Nowadays, meetings are everywhere. In addition to formal company meetings, small-scale discussions, communication with customers, participation in large-scale meetings, daily company affairs discussions, etc., there is a large amount of voice content that needs to be organized, recorded, and reviewed. Now on display, an advanced version of the meeting recording tool is launched, which is not only voice transcription, but also has new functions such as automatic summarization, role-based summary, AI suggestions based on the content of the discussion, and meeting content record generation.

After we launched the web version of meeting records around May, we also launched an offline speech recognition function APP based on years of research work in the speech field and recruiting partners in the speech field. Greatly reduce the cost of using AI conference services, allowing our products to truly serve real life.
